# TSP Solver Development Plan

## Project Overview
This is a high-performance Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver written in Rust with Python bindings. The core algorithm uses 3-opt local search with various optimizations including Don't Look Bits (DLB) and alpha-nearness candidate generation.

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
- Fast Rust implementation with clean Python API
- Advanced 3-opt algorithm with multiple optimizations
- Good project structure and build setup
- Pre-commit hooks in place
- Benchmarking framework established

### Areas Needing Improvement
1. **Documentation** - Minimal documentation throughout
2. **Testing** - Limited test coverage
3. **Code Cleanup** - Commented code and experimental files
4. **Organization** - Many result files scattered in root

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Documentation Enhancement (High Priority)
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation for Python bindings
- [ ] Document the 3-opt algorithm implementation in detail
- [ ] Add inline documentation to core solver components
- [ ] Create examples directory with usage examples
- [ ] Document the alpha-nearness heuristic approach
- [ ] Explain distance penalty system (pi values)

### 2. Testing Infrastructure (High Priority)
- [ ] Add Python tests for the `tsbee` module
- [ ] Create unit tests for each component in `/src/`
- [ ] Add integration tests with various TSP instances
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty input, single city, duplicate cities)
- [ ] Add performance regression tests
- [ ] Achieve >80% code coverage

### 3. Code Cleanup (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Remove commented code in `/src/main.rs`
- [ ] Consolidate playground scripts into proper examples
- [ ] Organize experiment results into subdirectories
- [ ] Review and clean up unused imports
- [ ] Standardize error handling across the codebase

### 4. Feature Enhancements (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add support for reading standard TSPLIB format files
- [ ] Implement parallel solving for multiple runs
- [ ] Add more TSP algorithms (Lin-Kernighan, genetic algorithms)
- [ ] Create a configuration system for algorithm parameters
- [ ] Add progress callbacks for long-running computations
- [ ] Implement solution visualization tools

### 5. Performance Optimization (Low Priority)
- [ ] Profile and optimize the 3-opt implementation
- [ ] Investigate SIMD optimizations for distance calculations
- [ ] Add caching for repeated distance computations
- [ ] Optimize memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Benchmark against other TSP solvers

### 6. Project Organization (Low Priority)
- [ ] Create `results/` directory for experiment outputs
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Add benchmarking suite with standard TSP instances
- [ ] Create performance tracking dashboard
- [ ] Set up documentation hosting (e.g., Read the Docs)

## Implementation Guidelines

### When Working on Documentation
1. Use Rust doc comments (`///`) for all public functions
2. Include examples in documentation where applicable
3. Explain algorithm complexity and performance characteristics
4. Document any mathematical formulas using LaTeX notation

### When Adding Tests
1. Follow Rust testing conventions
2. Use pytest for Python tests
3. Include both unit and integration tests
4. Test with various TSP benchmark instances
5. Use property-based testing where appropriate

### When Refactoring Code
1. Maintain backward compatibility with Python API
2. Run performance benchmarks before/after changes
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Update documentation accordingly
5. Follow Rust idioms and best practices

```

## Getting Started

1. Review the existing codebase, particularly `/src/solver.rs`
2. Run existing tests: `cargo test`
3. Build Python module: `maturin develop`
4. Test Python integration: `python -c "import tsbee; print(tsbee.solve.__doc__)"`
5. Review pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit run --all-files`

## Key Algorithms to Understand

1. **3-opt Local Search**: Core optimization algorithm
2. **Don't Look Bits (DLB)**: Speedup technique for local search
3. **Alpha-nearness**: Candidate generation heuristic
4. **Held-Karp Lower Bound**: For solution quality assessment
5. **Double-bridge Perturbation**: For escaping local optima

## Success Metrics

- All public APIs documented
- Test coverage >80%
- No commented/dead code
- Clean project structure
- Performance benchmarks documented
- Examples for common use cases
