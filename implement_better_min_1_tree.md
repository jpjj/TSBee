The goal is to use a faster implementation of prim's algorithm that uses heaps for calculating minimal spanning trees during the run of the held karp algorithm. In order to get a speed boost compared to the current calculation, the minimal spanning tree implementation with heap must not run on the complete graph. It should run only on the alpha nearness candidates that have been computed before held karp starts running.
Implement the new min spanning tree algorithm, integrate it in held karp and test whether the algorithm runs better than before. Conduct AB testing on randomly generated tsp instances to get a 99% confidence that the change improved the algorithm.
